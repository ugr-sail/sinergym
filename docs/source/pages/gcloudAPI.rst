Google Cloud integration

The script ``sinergym/utils/gcloud.py`` included with *Sinergym* allows easy configuration and cloud execution of experiments using the **Google Cloud** API.

The main objective is to create a **virtual machine** (VM) using **Google Cloud Engine** (GCE) to run the *Sinergym* container. This remote container can update the **Weights and Biases** tracking server with artifacts if the experiment is configured with these options.

Once an instance completes its task, the container will automatically remove its host instance from the Google Cloud Platform if specified.

**************************
Google Cloud configuration
**************************

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, set up your Google Cloud account and configured SDK (e.g., auth, project ID, permissions). Additional information is available `here <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`__. 

Then, it is required to have `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ installed in order to manage containers in Google Cloud. You can link **Google Cloud** with **Docker** as follows (see `authentication methods <https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication>`__):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud auth configure-docker

To avoid future issues with image build and Google Cloud permissions, you must **allow permissions for Google Cloud build** (more information `here <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/configure-access-for-cloud-build-service-account>`__).

It is also required to enable **Google Cloud services** in the *API library*. You can allow these services in your **Google account** using the **gcloud client SDK** or the **Google Cloud Platform Console**:

    - Google Container Registry API.
    - Artifact Registry API
    - Cloud Run API
    - Compute Engine API
    - Cloud Logging API
    - Cloud Monitoring API
    - Cloud Functions API
    - Cloud Pub/Sub API
    - Cloud SQL Admin API
    - Cloud Firestore API
    - Cloud Datastore API
    - Service Usage API
    - Cloud storage
    - Gmail API

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud services list
    $ gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
                             cloudapis.googleapis.com \
                             cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
                             containerregistry.googleapis.com \
                             gmail.googleapis.com \
                             sql-component.googleapis.com \
                             sqladmin.googleapis.com \
                             storage-component.googleapis.com \
                             storage.googleapis.com \
                             cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
                             pubsub.googleapis.com \
                             run.googleapis.com \
                             serviceusage.googleapis.com \
                             drive.googleapis.com \
                             appengine.googleapis.com

If *Sinergym* and optional dependencias such as SB3 are installed, the **Google Cloud SDK must be linked with other Python modules** for some functionalities to work. Execute the following command in your terminal:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud auth application-default login

Use the predefined container in Google Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our *Sinergym* container is currently uploaded to the **Artifact Registry** as a public image.  
You can use it **locally** or on a **GCE VM**.

.. code:: sh

    $ docker run -it eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym:latest

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instances create-with-container sinergym \
        --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
        --zone europe-west1-b \
        --container-privileged \
        --container-restart-policy never \
        --container-stdin \
        --container-tty \
        --boot-disk-size 20GB \
        --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
        --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

We also have containers available in Docker Hub. You can consult them in our `repository <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sailugr/sinergym>`__

.. note:: It is possible to change parameters to set up your own VM according to your preferences 
          (see `create-with-container <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create-with-container>`__).

.. warning:: The ``--boot-disk-size`` is essential. By default, the VM sets 10GB, which is insufficient for the *Sinergym* 
             container. This results in a silent error for Google Cloud Build.

Use your own container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have forked this repository and want to upload **your own container to Google Cloud** and use it, you can utilize ``cloudbuild.sh`` along with our ``Dockerfile`` for this purpose:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../cloudbuild.sh
    :language: sh

The following actions are performed:

    1. **Authenticate** with Google Cloud SDK.
    2. **Builds** the image locally, with parameters definition.  
    3. **Pushes** the built image to the Artifact Registry.  

Do not confuse the options section at the end of the file with the virtual machine configuration. Google Cloud uses a helper VM to build everything mentioned above. We use this *YAML* file to upgrade our container because the ``PROJECT_ID`` environment variable is defined by the Google Cloud SDK, so its value corresponds to your current project in the Google Cloud global configuration.

.. warning:: If your local computer does not have enough free space, it might report the same error explained in the previous section.

In order to use the configuration in ``cloudbuild.sh``, do the following:

.. code:: sh

    $ ./cloudbuild.sh -p PROJECT_ID -r REGION -R REPOSITORY -i IMAGE_NAME -t TAG -e EXTRAS

``-e`` option is the optional available package groups in Sinergym. By default, the container is built with the value ``'drl gcloud'``.

Create your VM or MIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a VM using this container, use the following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instances create-with-container sinergym \
        --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
        --zone europe-west1-b \
        --container-privileged \
        --container-restart-policy never \
        --container-stdin \
        --container-tty \
        --boot-disk-size 20GB \
        --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
        --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

.. note:: The option ``--container-restart-policy never`` is essential for proper operation.

To create a **Managed Instance Group** (MIG), first create a machine template:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container sinergym-template \
    --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
    --container-privileged \
    --service-account storage-account@sinergym.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control \
    --container-env=gce_zone=europe-west1-b,gce_project_id=sinergym \
    --container-restart-policy never \
    --container-stdin \
    --container-tty \
    --boot-disk-size 20GB \
    --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
    --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

.. note:: The ``--service-account``, ``--scopes``, and ``--container-env`` parameters will be explained 
          in the :ref:`Containers permission to bucket storage output`. Please, read that documentation 
          before using these parameters, as they require prior configuration.

Then, create a **managed instance group**:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create example-group \
        --base-instance-name sinergym-vm \
        --size 3 \
        --template sinergym-template

.. note:: If you encounter issues with VM initialization, check your quotas 
          `here <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas>`__.


Initiate your VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your virtual machine is now ready. To connect, you can use SSH 
(see `gcloud-ssh <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/ssh>`__):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute ssh <machine-name>

Google Cloud uses a **Container-Optimized OS** (see `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs>`__) within the VM. This OS has Docker pre-installed with the *Sinergym* container.

To use this container on your machine, simply run:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker attach <container-name-or-ID>

Now you can execute your own experiments in Google Cloud. For example, you can enter the remote container with ``gcloud ssh`` and execute the ``train_agent.py`` script for the desired experiment.

******************************************
Executing experiments in remote containers
******************************************

The `train_agent.py <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/scripts/train_agent.py>`__ and `load_agent.py <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/scripts/load_agent.py>`__ scripts are used to execute experiments and evaluations in remote containers. These scripts can be combined with features such as Google Cloud Bucket, Weights and Biases, and the auto-remove functionality.

.. note:: The **train_agent.py** script can also be used for local experiments and sending output data 
          and artifacts to remote storage, such as WandB, without configuring cloud computing.

The JSON structure for configuring experiments or evaluations is explained in the :ref:`Usage` section.

.. warning:: To ensure correct auto-deletion, it is recommended to use MIGs instead of individual VM instances.

To visualize remote logs in real time, log in `Weights & Biases <https://wandb.ai/site>`__ with your GitHub account.

Containers permission to bucket storage output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the ``remote_store`` option in ``train_agent.py`` to work correctly, the *Sinergym* template in the :ref:`Create your VM or MIG` section specifies the ``--scope``, ``--service-account``, and ``--container-env`` parameters. These parameters provide the necessary permissions for each container to write to the bucket and manage Google Cloud Platform.

To set up the service account and grant the required privileges, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new service account named **storage-account**:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud iam service-accounts create storage-account

2. Grant the *roles/owner* permission to the service account:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:storage-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/owner"

3. Create a JSON key file named ``google-storage.json`` in the project root directory (**this file should be ignored by git**):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create PROJECT_PATH/google-storage.json --iam-account=storage-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

4. Export the path to the JSON key file as the **GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS** environment variable on your local computer:

.. code:: sh

    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=PROJECT_PATH/google-storage.json

These steps ensure that the gcloud SDK uses the specified token for authentication.

*******************
Google Cloud Alerts
*******************

**Google Cloud Platform** provides functionality to trigger events and generate alerts. We have created a trigger in our gcloud project to notify when an experiment is finished. This alert can be received through various channels such as Slack, phone, or e-mail. Additional information about how to set up alerts, refer to the Google Cloud Alerts documentation `here <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts>`__.
