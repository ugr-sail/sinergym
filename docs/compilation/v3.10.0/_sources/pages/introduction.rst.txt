.. note:: Please, help us to improve *Sinergym* by **reporting questions and issues** 
   `here <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/issues>`__. Detailed 
   information on how to report issues is available
   `here <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue>`__. 

*Sinergym* includes the following features:

   - ⚙️  **Simulation engines compatibility**. *Sinergym* is currently compatible with the `EnergyPlus Python API <https://energyplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`__ for controller-building communication. Future updates may include additional engines such as `OpenModelica <https://openmodelica.org/>`__.

   - 📊  **Benchmark environments**. Similar to *Atari* or *Mujoco*, *Sinergym* allows the use of benchmarking environments to test and compare RL algorithms or custom control strategies.

   - 🛠️  **Custom experimentation**. *Sinergym* enables effortless customization of experimental settings. Users can create their own environments or customize pre-configured ones within *Sinergym*. Select your preferred reward functions, wrappers, controllers, and more!

   - 🏠  **Automatic building model adaptation**. Automatic adaptation of building models to align with user-defined settings.

   - 🪛  **Automatic actuator control**. Seamless management of building actuators via the Gymnasium interface. Users only need to specify actuator names, and *Sinergym* will do the rest.

   - 🤖  **Stable Baselines 3 integration**. *Sinergym* is highly integrated with Stable Baselines 3 algorithms, wrappers and callbacks.

   - ✅  **Controller-agnostic**. Any controller compatible with the Gymnasium interface can be integrated with *Sinergym*.

   - ☁️  **Google Cloud execution**. Support for easy Google Cloud execution.

   - 📈  **Weights and Biases logging**. Automate the logging of training and evaluation data, and record your models in the cloud. *Sinergym* facilitates reproducibility and cloud data storage through `Weights and Biases <https://wandb.ai/site>`__ integration.

   - 📒  **Notebook examples**. Learn how to get the most out of *Sinergym* through our Jupyter notebooks.

   - 📚  **Extensive documentation, unit tests, and GitHub actions workflows**. *Sinergym* follows proper development practices facilitating community contributions.
