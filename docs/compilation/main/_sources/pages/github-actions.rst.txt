Github actions

This project leverages `Github Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/>`__ for continuous integration and deployment.

The following procedures are implemented:

************
Pull request
************

- **Python Code format check**. Each pull request is checked following **pep8** `standard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ and `isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`__ for import sorting. Non-compliance triggers a warning.

- **Code type check**. `pyright <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`__ is used in the *Sinergym* module to control function and method I/O types. Type errors halt the workflow until resolved.

- **Documentation checks**. Changes in source documentation trigger a *Sphinx* compilation and spelling check. Errors are raised for compilation issues and unrecognized words. Add unrecognized but correct words to ``docs/source/spelling_wordlist.txt``.

.. Warning:: Sphinx warning messages are treated as errors.

.. Note:: Sphinx spelling also checks code docstrings.

- **Testing**. A remote container is built using *Dockerfile*, and **Pytest** is executed within it.

- **Repository security**. This workflow identifies differences between source and base in workflows and tests for forked repositories to prevent malicious software. 

.. Note:: Checks can be skipped with ``[ci skip]`` in the commit message. 
          See issue `#161 <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/issues/161>`__.

**************************************
Push to main (or merge a pull request)
**************************************

The following workflows are executed sequentially:

- **Apply format**. A bot applies necessary format changes (**autopep8** level 2 aggressive and/or **isort** module) 
  in the main branch.

- **Update Documentation build to GitHub pages**. A bot updates the documentation build in the **main** branch when necessary, including spelling checks.

- **Update the Docker Hub repository**. A container with all extra requirements is built and pushed to our `Docker Hub repository <https://hub.docker.com/r/sailugr/sinergym>`__ using the *latest* tag. A minimal container is also included with the *lite* tag.

- **Testing and CodeCov update**: Tests are executed similarly to the pull request event, and the coverage report is uploaded to CodeCov.

*******************************
New release created or modified
*******************************

- When a **release** is *published* or *edited*, a container is built and updated on Docker Hub 
  with the release tag version.

- Simultaneously, the **PyPi** *Sinergym* repository is updated with the current version tag.

- For **pre-releases**, the PyPi version is updated but not the Docker Hub container.

.. Note:: All the related code is available at `.github/workflows <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/tree/main/.github/workflows>`__.

.. Note:: If you forked *Sinergym*, enable Github actions in your project to utilize these functionalities.
