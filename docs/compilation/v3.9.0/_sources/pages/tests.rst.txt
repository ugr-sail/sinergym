Available tests
***************

Tests are available in the ``sinergym/tests`` directory. They are organized by different modules:

- ``test_common.py``. Tests the ``sinergym/sinergym/utils/common.py`` module. These tests check the functionalities of *Sinergym* common utils.

- ``test_reward.py``. Tests for ``sinergym/sinergym/utils/rewards.py``. These tests check the implementation of the defined reward functions.

- ``test_wrapper.py``. Test the wrappers defined in ``sinergym/sinergym/utils/wrappers.py``.

- ``test_simulator.py``. Tests for ``sinergym/sinergym/simulators/``. These tests check the low-level communication interface with the simulators.

- ``test_env.py``. Tests for ``sinergym/sinergym/envs/``. These tests check *Sinergym*'s' Gymnasium environments.

- ``test_serialization.py``. Tests for ``sinergym/sinergym/utils/serialization.py``. These tests check the serialization and restoration of environments and wrappers.

- ``test_controller.py``. Tests the controllers defined in ``sinergym/sinergym/utils/controllers.py``.

- ``test_modeling.py``. Tests for ``sinergym/sinergym/config/modeling.py``. These tests check the simulator configuration, including epJSON and EPW Python modules.

- ``test_stable_baselines.py``. Tests related to Stable Baselines 3 integration. These tests check the compatibility of 
  *Sinergym* simulation environments with Stable Baselines 3 algorithms. If Stable Baselines 3 package is not installed, these tests will be ignored by *Sinergym*.
