Usage example

Once *Sinergym* has been installed (either manually or via Docker), you can use the ``try_env.py`` script to test that everything is working correctly:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../scripts/try_env.py
    :language: python

The script instantiates a sample environment (``Eplus-demo-v1``) using ``gym.make``. It then runs a simulation of an episode and displays the average monthly rewards obtained. Note how the actions performed are randomly sampled from the action space.

Once the execution is complete, the resources are freed using ``env.close()``.

.. note:: After following this simple example, go to the examples section for more complex use cases.
