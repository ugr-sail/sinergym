## About Sinergym

*Sinergym* provides a [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)-based interface to interact with simulation engines such as *EnergyPlus*. This allows control in simulation time through custom controllers, including **reinforcement learning** agents.

For more information about *Sinergym*, refer to its [documentation](https://ugr-sail.github.io/sinergym/compilation/main/index.html).

## Main features

‚öôÔ∏è  **Simulation engines compatibility**. *Sinergym* is currently compatible with the [EnergyPlus Python API](https://energyplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) for controller-building communication.

üìä  **Benchmark environments**. Similar to *Atari* or *Mujoco*, *Sinergym* allows the use of benchmarking environments to test and compare RL algorithms or custom control strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è  **Custom experimentation**. *Sinergym* enables effortless customization of experimental settings. Users can create their own environments or customize pre-configured ones within *Sinergym*. Select your preferred reward functions, wrappers, controllers, and more!

üè†  **Automatic building model adaptation**. Automatic adaptation of building models to align with user-defined settings.

ü™õ  **Automatic actuator control**. Seamless management of building actuators via the Gymnasium interface. Users only need to specify actuator names, and *Sinergym* will do the rest.

ü§ñ  **Stable Baselines 3 integration**. *Sinergym* is highly integrated with [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) algorithms, wrappers and callbacks.

‚úÖ  **Controller-agnostic**. Any controller compatible with the Gymnasium interface can be integrated with *Sinergym*.

‚òÅÔ∏è  **Google Cloud execution**. *Sinergym* provides several features to execute experiments in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

üìà  **Weights & Biases logging**. Automate the logging of training and evaluation data, and record your models in the cloud. *Sinergym* facilitates reproducibility and cloud data storage through [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) integration.

üìí  **Notebook examples**. Learn how to get the most out of *Sinergym* through our [notebooks examples](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/tree/main/examples).

üìö  **Extensive documentation, unit tests, and GitHub actions workflows**. *Sinergym* follows proper development practices facilitating community contributions.

## Project structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

- `sinergym/`: the source code of *Sinergym*.
- `docs/`: *Sinergym*'s documentation sources.
- `examples/`: notebooks with several examples illustrating how to use *Sinergym*.
- `tests/`: *Sinergym* tests code.
- `scripts/`: auxiliary and helper scripts.

## Available environments

For a complete and up-to-date list of available environments, please refer to [our documentation](https://ugr-sail.github.io/sinergym/compilation/main/pages/environments.html#).

## Installation

Read [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage example

This is a simple script using *Sinergym*:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import sinergym

# Create environment
env = gym.make('Eplus-datacenter-mixed-continuous-stochastic-v1')

# Initialization
obs, info = env.reset()
truncated = terminated = False

# Run episode
while not (terminated or truncated):
    action = env.action_space.sample() # random action selection
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

env.close()
```

Several usage examples can be consulted [here](https://ugr-sail.github.io/sinergym/compilation/main/pages/notebooks/basic_example.html#Basic-example).

## Contributing

To report questions and issues, [open an issue](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/issues) following the provided templates. We appreciate your feedback!

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for specific details on how to contribute.

To better adhere to the required standards of this repository, we recommend running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x hooks/*
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

This will add git hooks that execute before using typical commands (add, commit, push, etc.) 
to verify that the methodology is correct before proceeding with the process.
